### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Summary

I hold a degree in Information Systems from Centro UniversitÃ¡rio UNA, and Iâ€™m 27 years old with over 4 years of experience in the data field, specializing in Data Engineering. I currently work on the digital transformation of ItaÃº ðŸ§¡, the largest bank in Latin America, where I apply my passion for technology to solve major challenges.

My professional journey began early, at the age of 15, as a Young Apprentice in the administrative area. During this time, I performed tasks related to customer service, management, and administrative operations. This early experience provided me with valuable learnings and contributed significantly to my personal and professional development until I transitioned into the data field.

I am currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Machine Learning Engineering at FIAP ðŸš€, which complements my role in Data Engineering and strengthens my focus on scalable solutions within the Data Platform Engineering context.

I believe in the power of technology as a catalyst for positive change and continuously seek to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in the industry. Lifelong learning is a priority for me, and Iâ€™m always ready for new challenges and growth opportunities.
